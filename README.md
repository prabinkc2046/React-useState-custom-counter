# A simple React Counter App 
Create a simple counter application with the following features:
Display a counter value on the screen.
Include two buttons: one for incrementing the counter and one for decrementing it.
Allow the user to reset the counter to zero with a separate button.
Add a feature that lets the user set a custom value for the counter.
Ensure that the counter value does not go below zero.
Use the useState hook for managing the state of the counter. Feel free to use any other hooks or features you find relevant to enhance the functionality.
